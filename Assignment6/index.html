        <h3>What is League?</h3>
        <p>
            League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, 
            is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and 
            published by Riot Games. In the game, two teams of five players battle
            in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their
            half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as
            a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During 
            a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, 
            earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the 
            game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the 
            enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.
